	AuthenticatorData From ยง6.1 of the spec.

	The authenticator data structure encodes contextual bindings made by the authenticator. These bindings are controlled by the authenticator itself, and derive their trust from the WebAuthn Relying Party's assessment of the security properties of the authenticator. In one extreme case, the authenticator may be embedded in the client, and its bindings may be no more trustworthy than the client data.

	At the other extreme, the authenticator may be a discrete entity with high - security hardware and software, connected to the client over a secure channel.In both cases, the Relying Party receives the authenticator data in the same format, and uses its knowledge of the authenticator to make trust decisions.

	The authenticator data, at least during attestation, contains the Public Key that the RP stores and will associate with the user attempting to register.
